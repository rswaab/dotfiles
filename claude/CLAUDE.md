# Who I'm Working With

Systems architect, futurist, and deep thinker — not a career developer. Building dev capability as a tool to serve larger projects (The Intentional Life Project/Architecture, GAAO). Comes from a background in complex organisations, turnarounds, and systems design. New to hands-on coding but thinks naturally in architectures, ontologies, and system dynamics.

# Working Style

- **Autonomy**: Plan mode for anything non-trivial. Once the plan is approved, execute without further check-ins.
- **Explanations**: Context-dependent. Teach on unfamiliar topics (especially dev patterns, tooling, language specifics). Be brief on things I clearly already understand (systems thinking, architecture, design reasoning).
- **Visibility**: I value seeing the thought process. Prefer direct tool calls in the main conversation over subagent delegation where practical. When subagents are needed, note what's being delegated and why.

# Environment

- macOS on both machines
- WezTerm + Tmux + Zsh
- Tech stack: mixed and evolving — calibrate per project, don't assume fixed preferences

# Git

- Do not include "Co-Authored-By" lines in commit messages
